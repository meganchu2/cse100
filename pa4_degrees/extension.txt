- problem solved: print out a possible schedule of classes
  for my major in order of course prerequisite fulfillment courses not
  printed can be taken at end in any order

- I solved this by creating a graph with directed edges, linking courses and 
their prerequisite courses, and using a queue that had priority based on if 
prerequisites were fulfilled.  if a course requires multiple prerequisites, 
the course will have to be "hit" that many times before it can be traversed
and go to the next course

- I tested this using a sample input file of prerequisite and course pairs for 
my major, creating a directed graph with edges, and iterating through 
the courses

- to run the program use the following format
  $ make extension
  $ ./extension <inputFilename> <outputFilename>   
  *I used courses.csv for input
!! NEED TO MAKE SURE all courses in input are typed the same way,
NO extra tabs or spaces
